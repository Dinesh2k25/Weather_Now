🌤️ Weather Now
🧭 Overview

Weather Now is a responsive web application built with React that allows users to quickly check the current weather conditions for any city around the world.
It displays temperature, wind speed, humidity, and an interactive map view of the selected location using React-Leaflet.

The app also supports dark mode, auto-suggestions for city search, and a clean adaptive layout for both desktop and mobile devices.

🎯 Objectives

The goal of this project is to create an interactive, user-friendly weather application that:

Provides accurate and real-time weather data.

Allows quick city-based searches with live suggestions.

Displays location visually on an interactive map.

Adapts seamlessly across desktop and mobile screens.

🌍 API References
1️⃣ Geocoding API

Converts a city name to latitude and longitude.

Example:

https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search?name=Chennai


Response:

{
  "results": [
    {
      "latitude": 13.08784,
      "longitude": 80.27847,
      "name": "Chennai",
      "country": "India"
    }
  ]
}

2️⃣ Weather API

Fetches current and forecast weather data.

Example:

https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=13.08784&longitude=80.27847&current_weather=true


Response:

{
  "current_weather": {
    "temperature": 31.5,
    "windspeed": 12.3,
    "weathercode": 1
  }
}

🧠 How It Works

User enters a city name in the search box.

The app fetches latitude and longitude from the Open-Meteo Geocoding API.

Using the coordinates, it calls the Open-Meteo Weather API to retrieve real-time weather data.

Data is displayed dynamically, and a map marker appears on the Leaflet map.

Weather info (footer card) updates accordingly with appropriate weather icons.

Responsive CSS ensures proper scaling across all devices.

City	Temperature	Wind Speed	Condition
Chennai	31°C	12 km/h	☀️ Sunny
London	15°C	8 km/h	🌧️ Rain
Tokyo	22°C	6 km/h	⛅ Partly Cloudy
